# ⚠️ CareTracker TESTING

**This is the staging/testing app.** Changes are built and tested here before being promoted to the real app at https://arnjnnngs.github.io/care-tracker/. It writes to a separate test database collection (`caretracker_test_entries`) — nothing here touches Brandi's real med history. Push notifications are disabled.

## Testing Version History (this repo)

| Test version | Date | Based on prod | Changes under test | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| t1 | Jul 13, 2026 | v27 | Chemo cycle: chemo date scheduling, Dexamethasone auto-appearing med (2 tablets, 8 AM & 2 PM, day before chemo through day after, missed-dose alerts), Zofran locked on chemo days 1–2 with override, phased red chemo banners (day −2 through +1) | Testing |

**Rollback:** every test version gets a full-history bundle saved before changes, same as production. To roll back, redeploy the previous test version's files.

**Testing notes:** log test doses freely — this app writes to `caretracker_test_entries`, not the real database. Use the date picker in "Chemo schedule" to simulate different days relative to chemo.

# Brandi's CareTracker

Real-time family medication & vitals tracker — a progressive web app (PWA) for logging medications, temperature, and weight with live Firebase sync and push notification reminders.

**Live App:** https://arnjnnngs.github.io/care-tracker/  
**Cache Reset:** https://arnjnnngs.github.io/care-tracker/reset.html  
**Repository:** https://github.com/arnjnnngs/care-tracker

## Overview

CareTracker is a single-page PWA built with vanilla JavaScript and Firebase Firestore. It tracks daily medication doses, temperature readings, and weight for a caregiver workflow. The app uses real-time Firestore listeners for instant multi-device sync and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for scheduled push notification reminders via GitHub Actions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules), inline CSS, single-file `index.html` (1042 lines)
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase Firestore (project `fuelforge-7c132`)
- **Push Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Automation:** GitHub Actions cron job for medication reminders
- **Fonts:** Hanken Grotesk, IBM Plex Mono (Google Fonts)
- **Firebase SDK:** v10.12.0 (ESM imports from gstatic CDN)

## Firebase Collections

| Collection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `caretracker_entries` | All logged data — meds, temperature, weight |
| `fcm_tokens` | Registered device tokens for push notifications |
| `fcm_tracking` | Tracks last-notified timestamps to prevent duplicate alerts |

## Service Worker Strategy

- **Cache name:** `caretracker-v19` (bump this to force updates on all devices)
- **Static assets (cache-first):** `./`, `index.html`, `manifest.webmanifest`, icons
- **Firebase/API calls (network-first):** `firestore.googleapis.com`, `gstatic.com`, `googleapis.com` — falls back to cache if offline

## Push Notification Reminders

The GitHub Actions workflow (`reminders.yml`) runs `send-reminders.js` every 30 minutes from 8 AM–10 PM CDT. It sends two types of reminders:

**Scheduled (time-based):**
- **8:30 AM** — Morning Meds: Protonix (morning) & Zofran
- **8:00 PM** — Evening Meds: Protonix, Iron, Buspirone, Paroxetine, Compazine

**Gap-based:**
- **Zofran** — checks if 8-hour gap since last dose has elapsed; sends "Zofran Available" notification. Uses `fcm_tracking/zofran_gap` doc to avoid duplicate alerts.

**Quiet hours:** No notifications between 10 PM and 8 AM Central.

## Tracked Medications

| Medication | Generic | Tracking Type |
|---|---|---|
| Tylenol | Acetaminophen | Daily limit (2500 mg, resets midnight), 4h min gap, 500/1000 mg doses |
| Zofran | Ondansetron | 8h gap timer, push notification when available |
| Compazine | Prochlorperazine | 6h min gap; 10 PM routine + earlier as needed (in Scheduled Meds card) |
| Morphine | Immediate release | 4h min gap, ½ tab (7.5 mg) / full tab (15 mg) doses |
| Lidocaine | Topical cream | 4h min gap, max 4 applications per day |
| Imodium | Loperamide | Daily pill count limit (4 pills) |
| Protonix | Pantoprazole | Twice daily windows (8 AM–noon, 8–10 PM) + reminders |
| Buspirone | BuSpar | Once daily, 10 PM |
| Paroxetine | Paxil | Once daily, 10 PM |
| Iron | Ferrous sulfate | Once daily, 10 PM |
| Senokot | Senna | 2 pills, 8 AM & 10 PM windows, as needed |

## Missed Dose Alerts

Protonix, Buspirone, Paroxetine, and Iron are tracked for missed doses. When one of their schedule windows closes with no dose logged, the app shows a red alert banner at the top of Today (covering today's and yesterday's misses, so an overnight miss is still visible the next morning), a red MISSED row in Today's Journal under the matching time category, and red MISSED rows plus a "N MISSED" day summary in History. A dose logged early (before the window opened, same day) counts as covering that window. As-needed meds (Senokot, Compazine, Tylenol, Zofran, Morphine, Lidocaine, Imodium) are never flagged. Tracking starts July 12, 2026 — no retroactive flags before that date.

## Vitals Tracking

- **Temperature** — logged in °F with timestamp
- **Weight** — logged in lbs with timestamp
- Both display last reading time and have dedicated input + "Log" button

## App Views

- **Today** — dose counters (shown only for meds used in the last 7 days), vitals inputs, individual quick-log cards (incl. Protonix and Senokot), and a grouped "Evening meds" card for Buspirone/Paroxetine/Iron/Compazine with a one-tap "Take all" button
- **History** — historical view of logged entries, grouped per day into Overnight (12–6 AM), Morning (6–noon), Afternoon (noon–5 PM), Evening (5 PM–midnight)
- **Weight** — weight tracking over time

## Troubleshooting: "All Blank" / Stale Cache

If the app shows a blank screen on a device:

1. Visit https://arnjnnngs.github.io/care-tracker/reset.html — this automatically unregisters all service workers, clears all caches, and redirects back to the app
2. Or manually: Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister, then hard refresh
3. On mobile: Settings → Site settings → arnjnnngs.github.io → Clear & reset

When deploying new versions, bump the `CACHE` constant in `sw.js` (currently `caretracker-v19`).

## Maintaining This Documentation

**When making changes to CareTracker, update these docs in the same commit:**

- **README.md** (this file) — Update the Version History table, and revise any sections affected by the change (e.g., if you add a new medication, update the Tracked Medications table; if you change the service worker cache strategy, update that section).
- **CARETRACKER_HANDOFF.md** — Update the "Last updated" date at the top, add the new version to the Version History table, and revise any affected sections (medication definitions, Firebase collections, reminder schedule, known issues, etc.).

Both files live in the repo root and serve as the single source of truth for onboarding new contributors or AI agents.
